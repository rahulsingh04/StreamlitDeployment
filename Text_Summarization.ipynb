Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf_directory/APJ_Speech.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic developm ent model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf_directory/APJ_Speech.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than \\n6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. \\nThey evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual \\nGarden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact \\nwith the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautif ul experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite  touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely  damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. T he villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master. Despite the severe l oss due to the earthquake,'),\n",

Here, I also witnessed the \\nparticipation of acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir along with State Government \\nauthorities in on-the-spot settlement of relief grants to be provide d to the victims whose \\nhouses had been damaged in the earth quake. I have experienced many s uch acts of \\ncourage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. \\n \\nCourage in combating calamities \\nIn 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha  village \\nduring my visit to Car Nicobar Islands. While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem  with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johanne sburg, South \\nAfrica. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I \\nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \\nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \\nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \\n \\nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Afri ca), 17 Super \\nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 \\ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected.

As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam recounts a question from a young girl, Anukriti, who questioned why India couldn't become developed before 2020. This anecdote sets the stage for his call to action and emphasizes the importance of youth engagement in achieving national goals.\n",

      "In his departing speech, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam reflects on his five years as President of India, expressing gratitude for the diverse interactions he had with people from all walks of life.  He highlights ten key messages gleaned from these experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accelerate development**: Driven by the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. **Empower villages**.\n",
      "3. **Mobilize rural strength for competitiveness**.\n",
      "4. **Invest in agricultural growth (Seed to Food)**.\n",
      "5. **Overcome challenges and succeed**.\n",
      "6. **Collaborate to solve problems**.\n",
      "7. **Show courage in facing calamities**.\n",
      "8. **Promote connectivity for societal transformation**.\n",
      "9. **Defend the nation with pride**.\n",
      "10. **Launch a youth movement for a developed India by 2020**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam emphasizes the importance of youth aspirations in achieving India's development, citing a memorable question from a young girl who questioned India's progress. He assures her that her dream will be acted upon, reflecting his commitment to addressing the concerns of citizens.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He underscores the potential of empowered villages, citing his visit to Nagaland where he witnessed a village council effectively managing financial resources and driving local development.  He also shares the story of the resilient people of Urusa, Jammu & Kashmir, who rebuilt their lives after the devastating 2005 earthquake, emphasizing the spirit of overcoming challenges. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam highlights the crucial role of courage and resilience in facing calamities, exemplified by the Car Nicobar islanders who adopted Tsunami victims as their own children.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stresses the need for better connectivity to facilitate the growth of rural India, illustrated by the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's \"Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas\" (PURA) initiative. This initiative connects 65 villages through physical, electronic, and knowledge infrastructure, leading to tangible results like:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Employment generation and entrepreneurship creation:** Supported by 1000 self-help groups.\n",
      "* **Land development:** 200 acres of wasteland transformed into cultivable land.\n",
      "* **Diversified economic activities:**  Villagers engage in Jatropha cultivation, herbal and medicinal plant farming, bio-mass power generation, food processing, and running marketing centers.\n",
      "* **International market focus:** \n",
      "  * Through collaboration with JETRO, villagers developed 55 internationally competitive lifestyle products based on local resources.\n",
      "  * This co-operative venture enhances the innovative ability of the PURA communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam envisions 7000 such PURA projects across India to bridge the rural-urban divide, highlighting the \"Seed to Food\" initiative as a crucial backbone for agricultural growth. He shares his experience meeting over 6000 farmers and emphasizes the need for a \"second green revolution\" driven by empowered farmers and agricultural advancements, aiming for a 4% annual growth in agricultural GDP.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He aims for a developed India by 2020, characterized by:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Reduced rural-urban divide.\n",
      "* Equitable access to energy and quality water.\n",
      "* Harmonious collaboration between agriculture, industry, and service sectors.\n",
      "* Education accessible to all meritorious candidates, regardless of background.\n",
      "* India becoming a top destination for talent and investment.\n",
      "* **A nation with universal access to quality healthcare.**\n",
      "* **A transparent and corruption-free governance system.**\n",
      "* **Eradication of poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children.**\n",
      "* **A prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy nation with sustainable growth.**\n",
      "\n",
      "His vision extends beyond national borders:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Kalam details the Pan African e-Network, connecting 53 African countries through a seamless network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless technology. This project aims to connect universities, hospitals, and educational centers, fostering collaboration and development across the continent.\n",
      "* He highlights India's contribution to the Pan African network, providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, since November 2006.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam concludes by expressing his pride in India's Defence Forces, who he met with personally during his time as President. He acknowledges their unwavering dedication to protecting the nation, and emphasizes the importance of their service. \n",
      "\n",
      "He further highlights the work of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, a group of citizens who are working to transform India's youth into enlightened citizens.  He provides specific examples of the foundation's impact, citing the transformation of students in Medak district and the story of Padma, a student leader who influenced her father to quit smoking. This, he believes, demonstrates the positive impact of value-based education and leadership on India's youth. \n",
